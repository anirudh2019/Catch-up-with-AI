# 📜 Vide Coding Workflows

---

## 🚀 Workflow-1
- A combination of **Firebase Studio** for prototyping *(and free use of Gemini 2.5)* → then use **Claude** for content/component help → then use **Cursor** to AI assist the code updates and actions.

---

## ⚡ Workflow-2

- **🗂 Planning:** **Gemini Advanced**, or **AI Studio** if you want free chat with Gemini 2.5 Pro. *(I use a custom bash script to bundle multiple files into a `.txt` to attach to the chat UI).* I don't want to plan in **Cline** to save usage for actual implementation.  

- **💻 Simple coding task:** **Gemini Code Assist**, then **Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp (free tier)**, then **Gemini 2.5 Flash** through **OpenRouter**.  

- **🧠 Complex task:** **Gemini 2.5 Pro Exp** via the Gemini API, or the **2.5 Pro Experimental/Preview** versions on **OpenRouter**.  

- **💰 Complex task but saving cost:** Use **Gemini Advanced** to generate a **detailed plan** *(maybe 3-5 milestones, described in detail – think 10k–20k words total for the plan)*. Then, copy each milestone description manually into the IDE and use **cheaper models** to follow each part.

## 🛠 Workflow-3
- **Cline + Gemini-2.5 Pro**

# 🌐 APIs for AI Models

| # | API / Model | Notes |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **OpenRouter** | Hub for cloud Models APIs<br>- Single API for any model.<br>→ Search on OpenRouter for free models |
| 2 | **Gemini-2.5 Pro, Flash, Experimental, Gemini Code Assist** | → For simple tasks, use **Gemini Code Assist** extension from Google *(free for individual usage)*<br>→ Gemini Experimental models have free APIs<br>→ **Gemini-2.5 Pro** has biggest context window and is great at coding |
| 3 | **GPT-5, 4.1, O4-mini** | — |
| 4 | **Qwen Code** | Free in OpenRouter |
| 5 | **DeepSeek R1, V3** | Free in OpenRouter |

> 💡 **Tip:** Check their **pricing**, **latency**, and **rate limits**.
